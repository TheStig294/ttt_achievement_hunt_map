_This is a map for Garry's Mod TTT, the below is a copy from the map's steam workshop page:_ <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2857904452>

# Welcome, to a high-effort, crazy TTT map

Yes, it's a Minecraft map, but _trust me_, this is not like any other TTT map you've played before, this map has some pretty cool stuff to it!

There are many custom-made achievements to earn, which point you towards all the crazy stuff on the map. After earning all achievements, you gain a permenant cosmetic reward!\
(Which also works on any other map, and can be toggled on and off after being earned!)

__This map has _no_ required textures!__ I've gone out of my way to make all map assets in-built, just hit subscribe and you're good to go!

# Features

- Over 20 custom-made achievements
- Sphax HD textures!
- Randomat Factory: Make your own custom randomats in-map!
- The TTT Quiz!
- Flyable airship!
- Day/Night cycle!
- Rain/Clear Weather cycle!
- Wearable top hat!
- Personality Quiz?
- Chests that do different things when you open them!
- Secret Among Us event...
- Aurora Borealis (at this time of year, in this part of the country...)
- Traitor Spa?
- Activateable custom scoreboard overlay!
- Combustible lemon?
- Totally 100% smart secret AI player?
- Super-secret final reward for earning all achievements!

# All the good stuff a TTT map should have

- _Plenty_ of guns on the ground!
- No external mods/textures/games required
- AI for your ai-based traitor weapons and bots! (A nav mesh)
- Proper metal/glass reflections (_Proper_, i.e. not the "omg why is my gun completely glowing white?" kind)
- A thumbnail icon for your map voting screen
- Traitor rooms
- Traitor tester, with 2 uses per round
- Teleport spots between far-sides of the map

# And there's more

If you install any of the following mods (or already have them), you'll be able to see _even more_ stuff to the map, extra things will happen with the: "openable chests that do stuff".

# Settings/Convars

On top of everything, this map also has a bunch of settings for you to customise to your liking!\
If you don't know what "_Convars_" are, I recommend just playing the map, as there are a bunch of /commands for you to type in chat, to change these settings instead!\
Don't worry, these only work for admins or whoever's hosting, and there are a bunch of signs in the relevant parts of the map that show exactly what they do.
\
\
__Chat Slash Commands__\
_/AHResetAchievements_\
Resets all achievement progress to 0, from the next round of TTT onwards\
(The final reward must be earned again)

_/AHToggleRandomat_\
Turns on/off allowing auto-randomat to trigger (regardless of your ttt_randomat_auto setting), any other source of randomats are still allowed\
(If you don't know what a "randomat" is, then this command does nothing)

_/AHToggleFactory_\
Toggles allowing players to use the "Randomat Factory", which applies special rules/effects to the game! (You'll see when you play the map...) If toggled off, it will take effect next round

_/AHToggleAmongUs_\
Turns on/off allowing the secret Among Us event to start, if toggled, this will not stop the Among Us event if it is already running
\
\
__Map Settings__\
